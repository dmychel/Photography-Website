# Photography-Website

(9/12/22)This will be my passion project, and my portfolio for my photography.I intend on using this as a break from Javascript, and to show off any new skills I gain. As of writing this I know very little about aligning photos on a webpage so it should be an ineresting start. It will be cool to watch my coding and photography skills grow as one and be documented at the same time
